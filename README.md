A website that offers an alternative to the learners log book. MEAN based.

Essentially (at least in Victoria, Australia) to get a license, you must complete a learners log while on your L plates. 
This book actually looks as ugly as a raw database. It's pretty gross.
This is an attempt to digitilise something that should be digital - a database.
Because it is virtual, I've made it look pretty and be easy to use. (No adding up time here).

It's made with the MEAN stack. Gradients from http://uigradients.com/# (Niiice)
